Chapter 01
==========

The hardest part of joining any social network is choosing your *nome de guerre*, the nickname by which you'll be known by every citizen of the World Wide Web whenever you channel your voice through its medium. Some people don't really think about this step, gladly accepting the very first suggestion offered by automated algorithms just so they can move on with their lives, the same way people automatically click on "I Accept" forms without ever looking at what type of legalese they've just accepted to sell their privacy to. That's not me! I find that your name has a very profound effect on people's first impression about you, specially online and how people perceive your character the first time they "meet" you. Even though the two suggestions I had, *IMl33t* and *CanHazKookie* sounded funny and appealed to my inner 16-year-old, I felt that I needed something a bit more professional and that would make it clear to others that I wasn't interested in fooling around and meant business. So after pondering for a good part of my afternoon at what I really wanted people to call me when I finally joined the freenode network, I chose a nickname that would leave no doubt as to what I stood for: **"GNUKemist"*. (**TODO**: expand on the reason for the nickname.)

freenode, spelled purposely with a lower case "f", is one of many (**TODO**: define) online communities that use the Internet Relay Chat protocol, or **IRC** for short, to create a online forum where people can communicate with each other via text-based channels and exchange information. Definitely not the most exciting way to talk to people compared to holographic chats and <another example goes here>, but when Professor Madeira gave out our midterm project for "History of the Internet", I had the dubious luck of being stuck with doing research about how people collaborated and shared ideas in the early 2000's.

* To Do:
  * Talk about GNU
  * Talk about how IRC played a major role in helping people collaborate on free and open software
